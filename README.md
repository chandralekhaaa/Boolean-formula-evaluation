# Boolean formula evaluation

Project Description
<br/>Used different Tree Classifiers to classify Boolean Formulae into solution and non-solution classes. Improved model performance by using Ensembling techniques such as Bagging and Random Forest. Compared the different tree classifiers based on Accuracy and F1 score.

Dataset
<br/>15 datasets were generated synthetically by randomly sampling solutions and non-solutions (with solutions having class '1' and non-solutions having class '0') from a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). 5 formulas were generated, each having 500 variables and 300, 500, 1000, 1500 and 1800 clauses (where the length of each clause equals 3) respectively and sampled 100, 1000 and 5000 positive and negative examples from each formula.
